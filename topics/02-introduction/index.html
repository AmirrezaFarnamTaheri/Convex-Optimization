      <div class="lecture-summary">
        <p>This lecture introduces convex optimization by defining what makes a problem "convex" and proving the fundamental theorem that any local minimum is also global. We examine the canonical problem families (LP, QP, SOCP, SDP), present the "loss + regularizer + constraints" modeling framework, and develop practical techniques for reformulating problems into standard convex forms. We also discuss why convexity is the watershed between tractable and intractable problems in optimization.</p>
        <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="../00-linear-algebra-basics/index.html">Lecture 00: Linear Algebra Basics</a> and <a href="../01-linear-algebra-advanced/index.html">Lecture 01: Linear Algebra Advanced</a> are recommended, particularly projections, PSD matrices, norms, and the fundamental subspaces.</p>
        <p><strong>Forward Connections:</strong> The definition of convex problems relies on convex functions and sets (Lectures 03-06). The modeling techniques introduced here are used throughout the course. Duality theory (Lecture 13) generalizes the optimality conditions proven here.</p>

        <h2>1. What is a Convex Optimization Problem?</h2>

        <h3>1.1 A Historical Perspective</h3>
        <p>The field of optimization has a rich history, evolving from calculus-based methods to the powerful algorithms we use today.
        <ul>
            <li><b>1940s:</b> Linear Programming (LP) emerges with George Dantzig's Simplex method and Kantorovich's work on resource allocation. John von Neumann develops duality theory.</li>
            <li><b>1950s-1970s:</b> Nonlinear optimization techniques develop, but a unified theory is lacking. "Local" methods dominate.</li>
            <li><b>1984:</b> Narendra Karmarkar introduces polynomial-time interior-point methods for LP, sparking a revolution.</li>
            <li><b>1990s:</b> Nesterov and Nemirovski extend interior-point methods to general convex problems (SOCP, SDP), establishing convexity as the key property for tractability.</li>
        </ul>
        Today, we understand that the "great watershed" in optimization is not between linearity and nonlinearity, but between <b>convexity</b> and <b>nonconvexity</b> (Rockafellar).</p>

        <h3>1.2 The Landscape of Optimization</h3>
        <p>Optimization is the mathematical discipline of finding the "best" solution from a set of alternatives. In the vast landscape of optimization problems, there exists a fundamental divide between two classes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Convex problems:</b> Solvable efficiently with guaranteed global optimality.</li>
          <li><b>Nonconvex problems:</b> Generally NP-hard, prone to local minima, no polynomial-time guarantees.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This distinction is not merely academic—it determines whether a real-world problem can be solved reliably at scale.</p>

          <figcaption><i>Figure 1.1:</i> The optimization landscape—convex vs. nonconvex problems represent fundamentally different computational complexity classes.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>1.3 Formal Definition</h3>
        <p>A mathematical optimization problem is <b>convex</b> if it can be cast in the following canonical form:</p>
        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \quad & f_0(x) && \text{(Objective function)} \\
        \text{subject to} \quad & f_i(x) \le 0, && i=1,\dots,m \quad \text{(Inequality constraints)}\\
        & A x = b && \text{(Equality constraints)}
        \end{aligned}
        $$
        <p>where three rigorous conditions must be satisfied:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Convex Objective:</b> The function $f_0: \mathcal{D} \to \mathbb{R}$ is convex. (i.e., its domain is convex and $f_0(\theta x + (1-\theta)y) \le \theta f_0(x) + (1-\theta)f_0(y)$).</li>
          <li><b>Convex Inequality Constraints:</b> The functions $f_i$ defining the sublevel sets must be convex. This ensures the set $\{x \mid f_i(x) \le 0\}$ is convex.</li>
          <li><b>Affine Equality Constraints:</b> The equality constraints must be linear/affine ($Ax=b$). Arbitrary convex equality constraints (like $x^2=1$) define non-convex sets.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><i>Note:</i> Minimizing a concave function is generally non-convex. Equality constraints $h(x)=0$ where $h$ is convex (but not affine) are generally non-convex (see "Counter-Example Corner" below).</p>

        <div class="insight">
          <h4>Deep Dive: Why Inequality $\le 0$ and Equality $Ax=b$?</h4>
          <p>The standard form is not arbitrary; it is designed to ensure the <b>feasible set</b> is convex.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Inequalities ($f_i(x) \le 0$):</b> This defines the 0-sublevel set of a convex function. Geometrically, this region is "bowl-shaped" (convex). If we used $\ge 0$, we would get the superlevel set (outside the bowl), which is typically non-convex (has a hole).</li>
            <li><b>Equalities ($h_i(x) = 0$):</b> An equality constraint forces the solution to lie on the boundary.
                <br>Mathematically, $h(x) = 0$ is equivalent to $h(x) \le 0$ AND $h(x) \ge 0$.
                <br>For the intersection to be convex, <i>both</i> sets must be convex.
                <ul>
                    <li>$h(x) \le 0$ is convex if $h$ is convex.</li>
                    <li>$h(x) \ge 0$ is convex if $h$ is concave.</li>
                </ul>
                The only functions that are both convex and concave are <b>affine</b> functions. Thus, equalities must be affine.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="example">
            <h4>🚫 Counter-Example: The Circle Boundary</h4>
            <p>Consider the constraint $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 1$. Let $h(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1$. This function is convex.
            <br>The equality constraint $h(x)=0$ defines the <b>boundary</b> of the unit circle.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The points $A=(-1, 0)$ and $B=(1, 0)$ are feasible.</li>
              <li>Their midpoint $M=(0, 0)$ is <b>not</b> feasible ($0^2 + 0^2 = 0 \neq 1$).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thus, the feasible set is not convex. In convex optimization, we can constrain solutions to be <i>inside</i> a bowl ($f_i(x) \le 0$) or <i>on</i> a flat plane ($Ax=b$), but not on the curved boundary of a bowl.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="insight">
          <h4>💡 Why These Conditions Matter</h4>
          <p>These three conditions guarantee that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The <b>feasible set</b> $\mathcal{F} = \{x \mid f_i(x) \le 0, Ax = b\}$ is a convex set.</li>
            <li>Every local minimum is guaranteed to be a <b>global minimum</b>.</li>
            <li>Efficient algorithms (interior-point, first-order methods) converge with <b>provable guarantees</b>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Violating even one condition (e.g., a non-affine equality constraint like $x^2=1$) can make the problem NP-hard.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>1.4 The Feasible Set</h3>
        <p>The <a href="#" class="definition-link">feasible set</a> (also called feasible region or constraint set) is:</p>
        $$
        \mathcal{F} = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid f_i(x) \le 0 \ \forall i, \ Ax = b\}
        $$
        <p>This is the set of all points satisfying all constraints. For a convex problem, $\mathcal{F}$ is convex—a property we'll prove in <a href="../03-convex-sets-geometry/index.html">Lecture 03</a> using operations preserving convexity.</p>

        <h3>1.5 The Meta-Skill: Converting Language</h3>
        <p>A core skill in convex optimization is translating between three languages:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Algebra:</b> Expressions like $Ax=b$, $\|x\|\le 1$, $f(x) \le t$.</li>
          <li><b>Geometry:</b> "Point lies in subspace," "inside a ball," "below a surface."</li>
          <li><b>Logic/Set Membership:</b> $x \in \{z : Az=b\}$, $x \in B$, $x \in f^{-1}((-\infty, t])$.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The core move is to turn every constraint into "$x \in \text{SomeSet}$" and understand how that set behaves under mixing (convexity) and transformations.</p>

        <h3>1.6 Optimal Value and Optimal Points</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Optimal value:</b> $p^* = \inf\{f_0(x) \mid x \in \mathcal{F}\}$ (can be $-\infty$ if unbounded, $+\infty$ if infeasible).</li>
          <li><b>Optimal point (solution):</b> $x^* \in \mathcal{F}$ is optimal if $f_0(x^*) = p^*$.</li>
          <li><b>$\varepsilon$-suboptimal:</b> $x$ is $\varepsilon$-suboptimal if $f_0(x) \le p^* + \varepsilon$.</li>
        </ul>

          <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Interactive Visualizer: Convex Hull Explorer</h3>
          <p><b>Understand the Building Block of Convexity:</b> A convex combination is the foundation of all convex geometry. This widget demonstrates how mixing points creates the convex hull:</p>
          <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
            <li><b>Drag the vertices ($v_1, v_2, v_3$):</b> Shape the triangle (convex hull).</li>
            <li><b>Drag the target point ($x$):</b> See if it can be formed as a convex combination of vertices.</li>
            <li><b>Barycentric Coordinates:</b> Observe the weights $\theta_i$. Inside the hull, all $\theta_i \ge 0$. Outside, at least one is negative.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><i>Geometric intuition:</i> A set is convex if it contains all convex combinations of its points. This prevents "holes" or "dents" that could trap optimization algorithms.</p>

        <h2>2. The Fundamental Theorem: Local = Global</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Global Optimality</h3>
        <p>In general (nonconvex) optimization, algorithms can get stuck in <b>local minima</b>—points that are optimal within a small neighborhood but not globally. For convex problems, this pathology cannot occur:</p>

        <div class="insight">
          <h4>⚠️ Common Misconception: Unimodal vs. Convex</h4>
          <p>It is often thought that any function with a single global minimum ("unimodal") is easy to optimize. This is <b>false</b>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Quasiconvexity:</b> A function can have a single minimum but still be non-convex (e.g., "bowl" shape with flat spots or weird kinks). While quasiconvex problems are solvable, they require specialized methods (bisection).</li>
            <li><b>Stationary Points:</b> A non-convex function can have a single global minimum but many saddle points or local maxima, which can trap gradient-based algorithms (vanishing gradients).</li>
            <li><b>Convexity is stronger:</b> Convexity guarantees not only uniqueness (under strict convexity) but also that <b>every</b> direction of descent points towards the optimum. This geometric structure allows for polynomial-time guarantees that mere unimodality does not.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="theorem-box">
          <h4>Theorem (Fundamental Property of Convex Optimization)</h4>
          <p>For a convex optimization problem, any local minimum is also a global minimum.</p>
          <p><b>Formally:</b> If $x^*$ is a local minimum (i.e., there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $f_0(x^*) \le f_0(x)$ for all feasible $x$ with $\|x - x^*\|_2 < \delta$), then $x^*$ is a global minimum.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="proof-box">
          <h4>Proof of Global Optimality (Narrative Walkthrough)</h4>
          <p>This proof uses a "straight line" argument. We show that if there were a better point anywhere else, the path leading to it would immediately drop in value, contradicting local optimality.</p>

          <div class="proof-step">
            <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Assume the problem is convex. Suppose $x^*$ is a <b>local minimum</b>. This means within some small radius $R$, no feasible point is better than $x^*$.
            <br><strong>Contradiction Assumption:</strong> Suppose $x^*$ is <b>not</b> a global minimum. This implies there exists a "challenger" point $y$ (somewhere far away) such that $f_0(y) < f_0(x^*)$.
          </div>

          <div class="proof-step">
            <strong>Step 1: The Path.</strong>
            Imagine walking from $x^*$ towards $y$. The path is the line segment $z(\theta) = (1-\theta)x^* + \theta y$.
            <br>Because the feasible set is convex, this entire path is safe (feasible). We never step outside the constraints.
          </div>

          <div class="proof-step">
            <strong>Step 2: The Slope.</strong>
            What happens to the objective value as we walk? Since $f_0$ is convex, the value along the segment lies below the chord connecting $f_0(x^*)$ and $f_0(y)$.
            $$ f_0(z(\theta)) \le (1-\theta)f_0(x^*) + \theta f_0(y) $$
            Since the destination value $f_0(y)$ is strictly lower than the starting value $f_0(x^*)$, the chord slopes <b>downward</b>.
            $$ f_0(z(\theta)) < (1-\theta)f_0(x^*) + \theta f_0(x^*) = f_0(x^*) $$
            Mathematically, for any step size $\theta > 0$, the value $f_0(z(\theta))$ is strictly less than $f_0(x^*)$.
          </div>

          <div class="proof-step">
            <strong>Step 3: The Contradiction.</strong>
            Take a tiny baby step along this path (very small $\theta$).
            This point $z(\theta)$ is:
            1. Valid (feasible).
            2. Very close to $x^*$ (inside the local radius $R$).
            3. Strictly better than $x^*$ (lower objective).
            This contradicts the fact that $x^*$ was a local minimum!
          </div>

          <div class="proof-step">
            <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The only way to resolve this contradiction is to reject the existence of the challenger $y$. Thus, no point better than $x^*$ exists anywhere. $x^*$ is global.
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>2.2 Practical Implications</h3>
        <div class="insight">
          <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>No need for global search:</b> Local search methods (gradient descent, Newton's method) are guaranteed to find the global optimum.</li>
            <li><b>No dependence on initialization:</b> Any reasonable starting point will converge to the global solution.</li>
            <li><b>Certificates of optimality:</b> First-order conditions provide verifiable certificates that a solution is globally optimal.</li>
            <li><b>Polynomial-time solvability:</b> Interior-point methods solve convex problems to arbitrary precision in polynomial time.</li>

        <h3>3.1 Computational Complexity</h3>
        <p>The distinction between convex and nonconvex problems is not merely about ease of solution—it reflects fundamental differences in computational complexity:</p>

        <h3>3.2 Real-World Impact</h3>
        <div class="example">
          <h4>Example: Large-Scale Machine Learning</h4>
          <p>Modern machine learning relies heavily on convex optimization:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Support Vector Machines (SVM):</b> Formulated as a convex QP, SVMs are solved reliably for millions of training examples.</li>
            <li><b>Logistic Regression:</b> Convex likelihood maximization ensures unique global optimum.</li>
            <li><b>LASSO Regression:</b> $\ell_1$-regularized least squares is convex, enabling sparse feature selection at scale.</li>
            <li><b>Deep Learning (first-order phase):</b> Even though neural networks are nonconvex, the convex optimization techniques (SGD, Adam) dominate the field.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>3.3 When Convexity is Lost</h3>
        <p>Certain problem features immediately destroy convexity. Recognizing these "red flags" saves time:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Integer constraints:</b> $x_i \in \{0,1\}$.
            <br><i>Why?</i> The set $\{0, 1\}$ is not convex (doesn't contain the interval $[0,1]$). This turns the problem into a combinatorial one (NP-hard).</li>
          <li><b>Equality constraints with nonlinear functions:</b> $h(x) = 0$ where $h$ is convex but not affine.
            <br><i>Why?</i> The set $x^2 = 1$ consists of two points $\{-1, 1\}$. It is the boundary of the convex set $x^2 \le 1$. Boundaries of convex sets are generally non-convex.</li>
          <li><b>Maximizing a convex function:</b> $\max \|x\|_2$.
            <br><i>Why?</i> The maximum is achieved at the boundary, not the interior. We want to find the point <i>furthest</i> from the center, which is a global search problem.</li>
          <li><b>Products of variables:</b> $x \cdot y \ge 1$.
            <br><i>Why?</i> The set $\{(x,y) \mid xy \ge 1\}$ (hyperbola) is non-convex. Its Hessian $\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ has eigenvalues $\pm 1$ (indefinite).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="insight">
          <h4>⚠️ Convex Relaxations</h4>
          <p>When faced with a nonconvex problem, a common strategy is <b>convex relaxation</b>—replacing non-convex constraints with convex approximations. The solution to the relaxed problem provides:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A <b>lower bound</b> on the optimal value (for minimization).</li>
            <li>Often a <b>high-quality approximate solution</b>.</li>
            <li>A starting point for local refinement methods.</li>

        <h3>5.4 Why LASSO Promotes Sparsity</h3>
        <div class="insight">
          <h4>⚡ Geometric Intuition</h4>
          <p>The $\ell_1$ regularizer promotes sparsity due to the geometry of its unit ball:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The $\ell_1$ ball $\{x \mid \|x\|_1 \le 1\}$ is a <b>cross-polytope</b> (diamond in 2D) with sharp corners at the coordinate axes.</li>
            <li>When the loss function's level sets (ellipsoids for least squares) expand outward, they tend to first touch the $\ell_1$ constraint set at a corner.</li>
            <li>At these corners, many coordinates are exactly zero.</li>
            <li>In contrast, the $\ell_2$ ball is round—contact points typically have no zero coordinates.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="proof-box">
          <h4>Analytical Reason: Subgradients at Zero</h4>
          <p>We can also see this algebraically. Consider minimizing a 1D objective $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}(x - y)^2 + \lambda |x|$.</p>
          <div class="proof-step">
            <strong>Smooth case ($\ell_2$):</strong> If we used $\lambda x^2$, the derivative is $(x-y) + 2\lambda x = 0$, giving $x = y / (1+2\lambda)$. This shrinks $y$ towards 0, but never hits exactly 0 unless $y=0$.
          </div>
          <div class="proof-step">
            <strong>Sparse case ($\ell_1$):</strong> The subdifferential of $|x|$ at $x=0$ is the interval $[-1, 1]$. The optimality condition is:
            $$ 0 \in \partial f(x) \iff 0 \in (x - y) + \lambda \partial |x| $$
            If we test $x=0$, the condition becomes $0 \in -y + [-\lambda, \lambda]$, which is true if $|y| \le \lambda$.
          </div>
          <div class="proof-step">
            <strong>Conclusion:</strong> If the data evidence ($y$) is small (specifically $|y| \le \lambda$), the optimal solution is <b>exactly zero</b>. The "kink" in the absolute value function at zero creates a "force field" that traps small values at zero. This generalizes to high dimensions.

        <div class="example">
          <h4>Example: LASSO Regression</h4>

        <h2>6. Standard Form Transformations and Rewrites</h2>

        <p>Many problems do not initially appear in standard convex form but can be <b>equivalently transformed</b> into LP, QP, SOCP, or SDP. Applying these transformations is essential for practical modeling.</p>

          <h4>Example: Robust Least Squares (Walkthrough)</h4>
          <p>We want to minimize the residual $\|Ax - b\|_2$, but we are uncertain about the matrix $A$. We model this uncertainty by assuming the true matrix is $A + \Delta$, where $\Delta$ is a perturbation with spectral norm bounded by $\rho$ (i.e., $\|\Delta\|_2 \le \rho$). Our goal is to minimize the <b>worst-case</b> error:</p>
          $$
          \min_{x} \left( \max_{\|\Delta\|_2 \le \rho} \|(A + \Delta)x - b\|_2 \right)
          $$
          <p>This looks like a complicated minimax problem. Let's transform it step-by-step into a standard SOCP.</p>

          <div class="proof-box">
            <h4>Derivation of Robust Least Squares SOCP</h4>

            <div class="proof-step">
              <strong>Step 1: Isolate the perturbation.</strong>
              Let's analyze the objective function $f(x) = \max_{\|\Delta\|_2 \le \rho} \|(Ax - b) + \Delta x\|_2$.
              Let $r = Ax - b$ be the nominal residual. We want to maximize $\|r + \Delta x\|_2$ by choosing $\Delta$.
            </div>

            <div class="proof-step">
              <strong>Step 2: Find the upper bound (Triangle Inequality).</strong>
              Using the triangle inequality $\|u+v\| \le \|u\| + \|v\|$:
              $$ \|r + \Delta x\|_2 \le \|r\|_2 + \|\Delta x\|_2 $$
              From the definition of the spectral norm, $\|\Delta x\|_2 \le \|\Delta\|_2 \|x\|_2$.
              Since $\|\Delta\|_2 \le \rho$, we have $\|\Delta x\|_2 \le \rho \|x\|_2$.
              Combining these gives an upper bound:
              $$ \max_{\|\Delta\| \le \rho} \|r + \Delta x\|_2 \le \|Ax - b\|_2 + \rho \|x\|_2 $$
            </div>

            <div class="proof-step">
              <strong>Step 3: Prove the bound is achievable (Tightness).</strong>
              We need to construct a specific "worst-case" perturbation $\Delta$ that achieves the upper bound.
              We want the vector $\Delta x$ to align perfectly with the residual $r$ (to maximize the vector sum) and for $\Delta$ to have the maximum allowed "gain" in the direction of $x$.
              <br>We construct $\Delta$ as a rank-1 outer product:
              $$ \Delta = \rho u v^\top $$
              where $u = \frac{r}{\|r\|_2}$ is the direction of the residual, and $v = \frac{x}{\|x\|_2}$ is the direction of the input.
              <br><b>Verification:</b>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Norm Constraint:</b> The spectral norm of a rank-1 matrix $uv^\top$ is $\|u\|_2 \|v\|_2$. Thus $\|\Delta\|_2 = \rho(1)(1) = \rho$. The perturbation is feasible.</li>
                <li><b>Worst-Case Alignment:</b> Apply $\Delta$ to $x$:
                  $$ \Delta x = (\rho u v^\top) x = \rho u (v^\top x) = \rho u \left( \frac{x^\top x}{\|x\|_2} \right) = \rho u \|x\|_2 = \rho \|x\|_2 \frac{r}{\|r\|_2} $$
                  This vector points exactly in the direction of $r$ and has magnitude $\rho \|x\|_2$.
                </li>
              </ul>
              Substituting this back:
              $$ \|r + \Delta x\|_2 = \|r + \rho \|x\|_2 \frac{r}{\|r\|_2} \|_2 = \| r (1 + \frac{\rho \|x\|_2}{\|r\|_2}) \|_2 = \|r\|_2 + \rho \|x\|_2 $$
              The bound is tight.
            </div>

            <div class="proof-step">
              <strong>Step 4: Reformulate the Optimization.</strong>
              The minimax problem is exactly equivalent to:
              $$ \min_x \left( \|Ax - b\|_2 + \rho \|x\|_2 \right) $$
              This is a sum of two norms (convex). To make it a standard SOCP, we introduce slack variables $t_1, t_2$.
            </div>

            <div class="proof-step">
              <strong>Step 5: Final SOCP Form.</strong>
              $$
              \begin{aligned}
              \min_{x, t_1, t_2} \quad & t_1 + \rho t_2 \\
              \text{s.t.} \quad & \|Ax - b\|_2 \le t_1 \quad (\text{SOC constraint 1}) \\
              & \|x\|_2 \le t_2 \quad (\text{SOC constraint 2})
              \end{aligned}
              $$
              We have transformed a scary minimax problem into a standard convex problem solvable by off-the-shelf software!

            <h4>Step-by-Step Reformulation</h4>
            <div class="proof-step">
              <strong>Step 1: Change of variables.</strong>
              Let $y = \frac{x}{e^\top x + f}$ and $z = \frac{1}{e^\top x + f}$. Note that $z > 0$.
              Then $x = y/z$.
            </div>

            <div class="proof-step">
              <strong>Step 2: Transform objective.</strong>
              The objective becomes:
              $$ \frac{c^\top x + d}{e^\top x + f} = c^\top \left(\frac{x}{e^\top x + f}\right) + d \left(\frac{1}{e^\top x + f}\right) = c^\top y + d z $$
              This is linear in $y$ and $z$.
            </div>

            <div class="proof-step">
              <strong>Step 3: Transform constraints.</strong>
              Substituting $x = y/z$ into $Ax \le b$:
              $$ A(y/z) \le b \iff Ay \le bz \iff Ay - bz \le 0 $$
              (Since $z > 0$, we can multiply through without flipping inequality).
              We also need the constraint that defines $z$:
              $$ e^\top x + f = \frac{1}{z} \implies e^\top (y/z) + f = \frac{1}{z} \implies e^\top y + f z = 1 $$
              And finally $z \ge 0$.
            </div>

            <div class="proof-step">
              <strong>Step 4: Final LP.</strong>
              $$
              \begin{aligned}
              \min_{y, z} \quad & c^\top y + d z \\
              \text{s.t.} \quad & Ay - bz \le 0 \\
              & e^\top y + f z = 1 \\
              & z \ge 0
              \end{aligned}
              $$
              Solving this LP gives $y^*, z^*$, and we recover $x^* = y^*/z^*$.

        <h3>7.1 The DCP Philosophy</h3>
        <p><b>Disciplined Convex Programming</b> is a methodology for constructing convex optimization problems by combining basic building blocks using a set of rules that preserve convexity. This approach underlies modeling languages like CVX (MATLAB), CVXPY (Python), and Convex.jl (Julia).</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Unboundedness Check:</b>

    <ul style="margin: 8px 0 0 20px; font-size: 0.9em; color: var(--text-secondary);">
        <li><b>Composition Rules:</b> The key to identifying convexity is to peel back the layers of functions. Norms are convex, affine maps preserve convexity, and sublevel sets of convex functions are convex.</li> <li><b>The PSD Condition:</b> Quadratic forms $x^\top Q x$ are the boundary between easy and hard; if $Q$ has even one negative eigenvalue, the function is nonconvex (has saddle points). This relies on the eigenvalue characterization from <a href="../00-linear-algebra-basics/index.html">Lecture 00</a>.</li> <li><b>Integer Constraints:</b> Discreteness destroys convexity because the domain is no longer a connected set, eliminating local-to-global gradient information.</li>

    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <ol type="a">
      <li><b>✅ Convex.</b> The objective $\|Ax - b\|_2^2$ is a convex quadratic function (composition of convex $\|\cdot\|_2^2$ with affine $Ax - b$), and the constraint $Fx = g$ is affine.</li>
      <li><b>❌ Not Convex.</b> The objective function $-\|x\|_2$ is concave (negative of a convex function), making this a concave maximization problem.</li>
      <li><b>✅ Convex.</b> Both $\|x\|_1$ and $\|Bx - c\|_\infty$ are norms (hence convex), and the constraint $\|Bx - c\|_\infty \le 1$ defines a convex set (sublevel set of a norm).</li>
      <li><b>❌ Not Convex.</b> The quadratic form $x^\top Q x$ is only guaranteed to be convex if $Q \succeq 0$ (positive semidefinite). Without this assumption, the problem is nonconvex.</li>
      <li><b>❌ Not Convex.</b> The integer constraint $x_i \in \{0, 1\}$ makes the feasible set non-convex (it's a finite set of points, not a convex set).</li>

The warehouse must be located within a region defined by linear inequalities $C x \le d$. Formulate this as a convex optimization problem.</p>

It is mathematically distinct from the Fermat-Weber problem (minimizing sum of Euclidean distances, not squared), which is an SOCP.

  <p>Consider a logistic regression model for binary classification. We have data points $(x_i, y_i)$ where $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are feature vectors and $y_i \in \{-1, 1\}$ are labels. The probability that $y_i = 1$ is modeled as: $$ P(y_i=1 \mid x_i; w) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-w^\top x_i}} $$ Formulate the problem of finding the weight vector $w$ that maximizes the log-likelihood of the data as a convex optimization problem. (Note: $P(y_i=-1 \mid x_i; w) = 1 - P(y_i=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{w^\top x_i}}$).</p>

        <li><b>Log-Concavity in Statistics:</b> Many fundamental probability distributions (Exponential family) have log-concave density functions. This means maximizing the likelihood (product of probabilities) is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood (sum of logs), which is a concave maximization problem (hence convex).</li> <li><b>Logistic Regression:</b> The specific loss function $f(z) = \log(1+e^{-z})$ is convex. This ensures that training logistic regression classifiers is a convex optimization problem with unique global optima (for regularized versions).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="solution-box">
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <div class="proof-step"><strong>Step 1: Write the likelihood function.</strong> Assuming independent samples, the likelihood is:
    $$ L(w) = \prod_{i=1}^m P(y_i \mid x_i; w) $$
    We can unify the probability expression. Notice that $P(y_i \mid x_i; w) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-y_i w^\top x_i}}$.
    <br>Check: If $y_i=1$, $\frac{1}{1+e^{-w^\top x_i}}$. If $y_i=-1$, $\frac{1}{1+e^{w^\top x_i}} = \frac{e^{-w^\top x_i}}{1+e^{-w^\top x_i}} = 1 - \frac{1}{1+e^{-w^\top x_i}}$. Using the identity $1 - \sigma(z) = \sigma(-z)$:
    $$ P(y=-1) = \frac{1}{1+e^{w^\top x}} = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(-1)w^\top x}} $$

    $$ f''(z) = \frac{e^z(1+e^z) - e^z(e^z)}{(1+e^z)^2} = \frac{e^z}{(1+e^z)^2} > 0 $$
    Our objective is a sum of terms $f(-y_i w^\top x_i)$. Since $f$ is convex and the argument $-y_i w^\top x_i$ is affine in $w$, the composition is convex.
    The sum of convex functions is convex.</div>
    <div class="proof-step"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The optimization problem is:
    $$ \min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^n} \sum_{i=1}^m \log(1 + e^{-y_i w^\top x_i}) $$

        <li><b>Definition is King:</b> While Hessians and composition rules are convenient shortcuts, the inequality definition is the "ground truth" of convexity. Being able to prove convexity directly from the definition is a crucial skill for understanding <i>why</i> a function is convex.</li> <li><b>Quadratic Behavior:</b> The function $\|Ax-b\|^2$ is a "quadratic bowl". Along any line, its values trace a parabola opening upward.

  <div class="solution-box">
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <div class="proof-step"><strong>Step 1: Simplify using affine composition.</strong>
    Let $g(u) = \|u\|_2^2 = u^\top u$. We know $f(x) = g(Ax-b)$.
    It is sufficient to prove that $g(u)$ is convex, because if $g$ is convex, then $f(x) = g(Ax-b)$ is convex (affine composition).
    We prove $g(u) = \|u\|_2^2$ is convex.</div>
    <div class="proof-step"><strong>Step 2: Expand the convex combination.</strong>
    Let $u, v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\theta \in [0,1]$. Let $z = \theta u + (1-\theta)v$.
    $$ g(z) = \|\theta u + (1-\theta)v\|_2^2 = (\theta u + (1-\theta)v)^\top (\theta u + (1-\theta)v) $$
    $$ = \theta^2 u^\top u + 2\theta(1-\theta) u^\top v + (1-\theta)^2 v^\top v $$
    $$ = \theta^2 \|u\|^2 + 2\theta(1-\theta) u^\top v + (1-\theta)^2 \|v\|^2 $$</div>
    <div class="proof-step"><strong>Step 3: Analyze the RHS of the definition.</strong>
    The target is $\theta g(u) + (1-\theta)g(v) = \theta \|u\|^2 + (1-\theta)\|v\|^2$.</div>
    <div class="proof-step"><strong>Step 4: Compute the difference (RHS - LHS).</strong>
    $$ \Delta = [\theta \|u\|^2 + (1-\theta)\|v\|^2] - [\theta^2 \|u\|^2 + 2\theta(1-\theta) u^\top v + (1-\theta)^2 \|v\|^2] $$
    Group terms by $\|u\|^2$. Coefficient is $\theta - \theta^2 = \theta(1-\theta)$.
    <br>Group terms by $\|v\|^2$. Coefficient is $(1-\theta) - (1-\theta)^2 = (1-\theta)(1 - (1-\theta)) = (1-\theta)\theta$.
    <br>The cross term is $-2\theta(1-\theta) u^\top v$.
    <br>Factor out the common term $\theta(1-\theta)$:
    $$ \Delta = \theta(1-\theta) \left[ \|u\|^2 + \|v\|^2 - 2u^\top v \right] $$
    Recognize the term in brackets as the squared norm of difference:
    $$ \Delta = \theta(1-\theta) \|u - v\|_2^2 $$</div>
    <div class="proof-step"><strong>Step 5: Conclusion.</strong>
    Since $\theta \in [0,1]$, both $\theta$ and $(1-\theta)$ are non-negative. Also, the squared norm $\|u-v\|_2^2$ is always non-negative.
    Thus, $\Delta \ge 0$, which implies:
    $$ \theta g(u) + (1-\theta)g(v) \ge g(\theta u + (1-\theta)v) $$
    So $g(u)$ is convex, and consequently $f(x) = \|Ax-b\|_2^2$ is convex.</div>

    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p><b>Example 1:</b> $f(x) = x^4$.

    Canceling $x^\top x$ from both sides:
