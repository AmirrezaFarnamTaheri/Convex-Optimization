Right: Minkowski difference/erosion S1⊖S2 = {x | x+S2 ⊆ S1}, visualized as the set of translations where S2 still fits inside S1."

    "description": "Animation showing vector space axioms are universal across different worlds. Three panels evolving in sync: R² vectors, polynomials a+bx, and functions a*sin(t)+b*cos(t). Same coefficients a(t), b(t) drive all three simultaneously. Proves vector spaces are not defined by geometry—they are defined by addition, scalar multiplication, and axioms."

    "description": "Animation distinguishing subspace from affine set. Blue arrow: vector in subspace (line through origin). Red arrow: same vector plus fixed offset → affine set. Both move identically but one always passes through 0, the other never does. Clarifies: Ax=0 is a subspace, Ax=b is affine (unless b=0)."

Red arrow: all linear combinations αv1+βv2 reach everything v3 ever could. Locks in: span = all linear combinations, redundancy = vectors adding no new reach, basis = minimal spanning set."
