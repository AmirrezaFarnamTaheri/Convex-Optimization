    "description": "A nearest-point projection diagram. A point y lies outside a convex set C, and its projection x0 = Π_C(y) is the unique closest point in C. The segment y−x0 is perpendicular to a supporting hyperplane at x0, illustrating the variational characterization of projection and its use in separation."
