# Documentation Reading Guide

Start with the docs that exist in this repository:

1. **`SETUP.md`**: How to run the site locally for development/testing.
2. **`image-source-notes/`**: Notes about image provenance and adoption plans.

Additional documentation (project structure, data schemas, widget architecture, and deployment) is planned but not yet included.
