## ⚠️ Disclaimer
**These are my Personal HandNotes for the Convex Optimization Course by Prof. Hesam Rajabzadeh, TeIAS-2025.**

I do not personally have eligibility for providing any sort of educational material. So these are **JUST** my personal handnotes, generated by myself. While I have tried to resolve potential issues and misunderstandings by using **OpenAI GPT-5.1-Pro-Extended-Thinking** and **Google Gemini 3 Pro-Preview** for proofreading, there might still be misunderstandings on my side or incorrect parts in the content.
